# Reproduction Guide: Teen Social Media Usage and Mental Health Analysis

## Introduction
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for reproducing the results of the analysis on teen social media usage and mental health. The analysis includes data generation, data import, summary statistics, and visualization using R and Python.

## Step 1: Data Generation (Python)
1. Open `dataset.py` in a Python environment.
2. Execute the script to generate synthetic data for the analysis.
3. The script will create a CSV file named `social_media_mental_health.csv` in the `dataverse_files` directory.

## Step 2: Data Import and Analysis (R)
1. Open `data.r` in an R environment.
2. Make sure the required libraries (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`) are installed.
3. Execute the script to import the generated CSV file and perform analysis.
4. The script will sample 100 rows from the dataset for analysis.
5. Summary statistics and visualizations will be generated, including:
   - Distribution of social media usage frequency among adolescents (Bar chart)
   - Correlation between social media usage duration and anxiety levels (Scatter plot)
   - Variation in social media usage duration across age groups (Box plot)
6. The generated graphs will be displayed in the R environment.

## Running the Paper

To run the paper.qmd file and generate the final report, follow these steps:

1. Open the paper.qmd file in a Markdown editor or a compatible text editor.
2. Make sure you have the necessary software installed, including R, Python, and the required libraries mentioned in the paper.qmd file.
3. Ensure that the dataset file (social_media_mental_health.csv) is in the correct directory as specified in the paper.qmd file.
4. Run the paper.qmd file using a Markdown compiler or rendering tool to generate the final report in PDF format.

Once the steps above are completed, the final report will be generated, providing detailed insights into the analysis of teen social media usage and mental health indicators.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure Python and R environments are properly set up with required libraries installed.
- Adjust parameters in the Python script (`dataset.py`) if necessary, such as sample size or data generation logic.
- Feel free to customize the R script (`data.r`) for additional analysis or visualization.
